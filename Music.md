## Music

I'm a big fan of music, I listen to all kinds of it from just about every genre. 

I've played the guitar since I was 11 when my dad gave me his old one, and I play in a terrible rock band.

In addition to awful rock music, I make awful hip-hop beats and electronic music, feel free to check out this [animated short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s3qSr79NeQ&t=2s) I did all the audio and soundtrack for or my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-980774474-979462562)
